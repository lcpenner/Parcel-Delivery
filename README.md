# Parcel Delivery Routing Program

The program implements a nearest neighbor algorithm to route parcel delivery trucks.

The program reads delivery data from CSVs, loads the trucks, schedules the deliveries, and provides final delivery information.

Creating classes for the trucks and packages allows the program to scale and adapt to the demands of the delivery schedule and the resources available.

Package and destination information is stored in hash tables to allow for the program to easily accommodate more packages and destinations. 

The program was developed using Python 3.7 on Pycharm 2022.1.3 (Community Edition)
